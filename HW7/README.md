This assignment deals with Deep Dream. The deep dream is a neural network for classifying animals. This assignment is helpful not only for creating some images
but also for learning about some of the different layers of neural networks. Adjusting the sliders to change the strength of the deep dream can help us choose our 
preferred images and patterns.
