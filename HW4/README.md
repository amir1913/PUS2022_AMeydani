Steve and I did this assignment.

The goal of assignment 2 is to plot information on a table to analyze data visually. This means that geopandas and other libraries can help people see 
some data, i.e. the number of bike stations in a city, on a map to comprehensively analyze their questions or concerns. So plotting tool help to observe
the happenings around us better. Mapping is also essential as it gives us an excellent view of making quick and effective decisions.
In this assignment, we learned how to make our data more understandable.
