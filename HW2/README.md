# Question:
Do the farmers on the way downstream from the dam use the water released for the environmental needs of the lake?


# General idea
Farmers are one of the main reasons for the reduction of water delivered to Urmia lake as there is less reduction in non-agricultural seasons compared to agricultural seasons. 


# Alternative hypothesis:
The environmental demand of Urmia lake can not be supplied in agricultural seasons like spring and summer because farmers employ water released from the upstream dam. Based on reports, there are nearly 10000 farms on the way to the lake. The average area of each farm is 2 ha. Based on data derived from remote sensing and Landsat 8 products, the evapotranspiration (ET) rate in the agricultural season is five times more than in non-agricultural seasons. A 10-year average ET in the region during seasonal forecast is almost 4 mm/day. The released water to Urmia lake in agricultural seasons is 1 BCM, and about 20 percent of that share should be delivered to the lake and the rest to supply drinking and agricultural water. Based on the reports of gauge stations, just 20 percent of the lake's water need is delivered. In non-agricultural seasons, the water consumed by the farmers is one-fifth of the cropping (agricultural) seasons. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that water released upstream in non-cropping seasons is one-third of the amount released in the rest of the year, with a proportion of 1 (agriculture and drinking water) to 4 (environmental demand). In these times, 80% of the share of the lake is delivered. 


# Null hypothesis:
It is possible to fully supply the environmental water needs of Urmia lake even in agricultural seasons when farmers are irrigating their farms and gardens.


# Comments on experimental design:
By using some simple mathematic operations, it is possible to obtain agrucultural water consumption in cropping and non-cropping seasons.

Issues:
- The problem should state that agricultural and non-agricultural seasons include precisely which ones.
- General idea does not include specific details about other water supply sources like groundwater. So this factor could possibly affect the correctness of the general idea.
- A penetration rate of water into the underground is not given by the problem. Without having penetration rates in non-agricultural and agricultural seasons, there may be some uncertainties as dry soil absorb more water than wet one; however, the difference between them is not significant.
