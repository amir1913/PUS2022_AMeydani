This assignment is done by me.

I apologize for the late uploading of this assignment. I shouldn't bring any excuse for this. Although you gave me enough time for this homework during the past week, 
I didn't feel good about doing my work and projects and felt homesick, So I didn't work an hour per day efficiently. That's why I take most of my time buying and
assembling furniture for my new apartment.I didn't pay attention to the assignment's deliveries carefully, so I didn't know we needed to do the homework for two cities until
now (That's embarrassing). What is important for me so far is that I learned many things from this course since I did not know anything about Python. So thank you.

In this assignment, I have investigated Chicago's energy benchmarking using the Random Forest regression tree. This is done to find the most influential
variables on the site energy usage of each building so that we understand energy consumption changes with the changing of which variables. From the technical
perspective, I will learn how to implement regression-based data-driven modeling by starting from a row CSV file and then collecting the features' importance ratio.
