Due to the importance of the Energy supply and market efficiency, evaluating the energy consumed against different variables can give a good perspective to the policymakers in order to implement their best plans for having efficient energy systems and reducing energy consumption in major cities. The data-driven benchmarking method used in this study helped them employ a low-cost comprehensive survey method. Without using data-driven methods and open data, the cost of implementing Commercial Building Energy Consumption Surveys would be higher, with less or equal accuracy.\n",

        "Fig 2. This figure shows the importance of different variables used in this method. The target variable for the training regression model is Site EUI. This variable is the amount of heat and electricity consumed by the building. So variables having a more significant correlation with Site EUI would have greater MDI. Based on the result, Weather Normalized Site EUI, Source EUI, and GHG Intensity have the highest scores in a row, which seems rational because they all correlate closely with Site EUI. Natural gas has less connectivity because electrical energy is a large share of the user market, not gas. In the following levels, there is property type such as public places, universities, hotels, and groceries, which because of having central heating and cooling systems, consume more energy than residential complexes. Although the random forest method does not reveal causal relationships between variables, it could give important information about the correlations."
